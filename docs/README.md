# @vime/docs

Vime is simply a collection of [web components](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components)
that help you easily build and customize your our own media player. This package contains the source
code for the Vime documentation site hosted at https://vimejs.com. The website is built using
[Docusaurus 2](https://v2.docusaurus.io/), a modern static website generator.

## Local Development

```bash
$: pnpm install --filter vime && pnpm install

$: npm run start
```

The `start` command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window. Most changes
are reflected live without having to restart the server.

## API Documentation

It's important to note that **[`docs/components`](./docs/components) is autogenerated** by
`@vime/core`. If you'd like to update those docs run the following commands:

```bash
$: cd ..

$: npm run setup

$: cd packages/core
```

Update any component docs inside [`src/components`](../packages/core/src/components) and then run
the following to update:

```bash
$: npm run build
```
