# @vime/docs

Vime is simply a collection of [web components](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components)
that help you easily build and customize your our own media player. This package contains the source
code for the Vime documentation site hosted at https://vimejs.com. The website is built using
[Docusaurus 2](https://v2.docusaurus.io/), a modern static website generator.

### Local Development

```bash
$: npm install

$: npm run start
```

This command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window. Most changes are
reflected live without having to restart the server.

It's important to note that **`docs/components` is autogenerated** by `@vime/core`. If you'd like
to update those docs run the following commands:

```bash
$: cd ..

$: npm run setup

$: cd packages/core

# Update the docs inside `src/components` and then run:
$: npm run build
```
