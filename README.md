Vime is simply a collection of [web components](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components) 
that help you easily build your own media player. See the [Features](#features) section below for 
some more highlights on what Vime provides.

üç≠ They say a picture is worth a thousand words ...

```html
<vime-player autoplay muted controls>
  <vime-video poster="/media/poster.png" cross-origin>
    <!-- Why `data-src`? Lazy loading. You can always use `src` if you don't need it. -->
    <source data-src="/media/video.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
    <track default kind="subtitles" src="/media/subs/en.vtt" srclang="en" label="English" />
    <track kind="subtitles" src="/media/subs/es.vtt" srclang="es" label="Spanish" />
  </vime-video>
</vime-player>
```

*Custom UI?*

```html
<vime-player autoplay muted>
  <vime-youtube video-id="DyTCOwB0DVw" />

  <vime-ui>
    <vime-click-to-play />
    <vime-captions />
    <vime-poster />
    <vime-spinner />
    <vime-default-settings />
    <vime-controls pin="bottomLeft" active-duration="2750" full-width>
      <vime-playback-control tooltip-direction="right" />
      <vime-volume-control />
      <vime-time-progress />
      <vime-control-spacer />
      <vime-caption-control />
      <vime-pip-control keys="p" />
      <vime-settings-control />
      <vime-fullscreen-control keys="f" tooltip-direction="left" />
    </vime-controls>
  </vime-ui>
</vime-player>
```

*In a hurry?*

```html
<vime-player theme="light" autoplay muted>
  <vime-audio cross-origin>
    <source data-src="/media/audio.mp3" type="audio/mp3" />
  </vime-audio>

  <vime-default-ui />
</vime-player>
```
