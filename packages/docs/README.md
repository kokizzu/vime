# @vime/docs

Vime is simply a collection of [web components](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components) 
that help you easily build and customize your our own media player. This package contains the source 
code for the Vime documentation site hosted at https://vimejs.com. The website is built using 
[Docusaurus 2](https://v2.docusaurus.io/), a modern static website generator.

### Local Development

```bash
$: npm run start
```

This command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window. Most changes are 
reflected live without having to restart the server.
