# @vime/html-example

This example demonstrates how to load and use Vime with HTML via the `@vime/core` package. The
main file to look at is [`index.html`](./index.html).

For the curious, [`@vime/media`](../../packages/media) is a private package that contains a collection
of audio and video files, and are used here to help with demonstrating the player. You're free to
ignore it and supply your own media files.

## Usage

Install [pnpm](https://pnpm.js.org/en/installation) and then run the following commands to serve
the example.

```bash
$: pnpm install

$: npm run serve
```
