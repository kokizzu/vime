# @vime/html-example

This example demonstrates how to setup Vime with HTML via the `@vime/core` package. See [`index.html`](./index.html).

For the curious, [`@vime/media`](../../packages/media) is a private package that contains a collection
of audio and video files, and are used here to help with demonstrating the player. You're free to
ignore it and supply your own media files.

## Usage

Install [pnpm](https://pnpm.js.org/en/installation) and then run the following commands to serve
the example.

```bash
# This will take some time (~480MB), but you only have to do it once.
$: git clone https://github.com/vime-js/vime

$: cd vime/examples/html

$: npm run setup

$: npm run serve
```
