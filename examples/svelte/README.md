# Vime Svelte Example

This example was bootstrapped using the [`sveltejs/template`](https://github.com/sveltejs/template), 
and demonstrates how to load and use Vime with Svelte via the `@vime/core` package. The main files to 
look at are `public/index.html` for loading, and `src/App.svelte` for usage.
