# @vime/svelte-example

This example was bootstrapped using the [`sveltejs/template`](https://github.com/sveltejs/template),
and demonstrates how to load and use Vime with Svelte via the `@vime/core` package. The main files to
look at are [`public/index.html`](./public/index.html) for loading, and [`src/App.svelte`](./src/App.svelte)
for usage.

For the curious, [`@vime/media`](../../packages/media) is a private package that contains a collection
of audio and video files, and are used here to help with demonstrating the player. You're free to
ignore it and supply your own media files.

## Usage

Install [pnpm](https://pnpm.js.org/en/installation) and then run the following commands to serve
the example.

```bash
$: pnpm install

$: npm run serve
```
