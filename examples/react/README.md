# @vime/react-example

This example was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app),
and demonstrates how to load and use Vime with React via the `@vime/react` package. The main
file to look at is [`App.tsx`](./src/App.tsx).

For the curious, [`@vime/media`](../../packages/media) is a private package that contains a collection
of audio and video files, and are used here to help with demonstrating the player. You're free to
ignore it and supply your own media files.

## Usage

```bash
$: pnpm install

$: npm run serve
```
