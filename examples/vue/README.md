# @vime/vue-example

This example was bootstrapped with [Vue CLI](https://cli.vuejs.org/), and demonstrates how to load
and use Vime with Vue via the `@vime/vue` package. The main file to look at is
[`src/App.vue`](./src/App.vue).

For the curious, [`@vime/media`](../../packages/media) is a private package that contains a collection
of audio and video files, and are used here to help with demonstrating the player. You're free to
ignore it and supply your own media files.

## Usage

Install [pnpm](https://pnpm.js.org/en/installation) and then run the following commands to serve
the example.

```bash
$: pnpm install

$: npm run serve
```
