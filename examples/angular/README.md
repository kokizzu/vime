# @vime/angular-example

This example was bootstrapped with [Angular CLI](https://cli.angular.io), and demonstrates how to
load and use Vime with Angular via the `@vime/angular` package. The main files to look at
are in the [`app`](./src/app) module directory.

For the curious, [`@vime/media`](../../packages/media) is a private package that contains a collection
of audio and video files, and are used here to help with demonstrating the player. You're free to
ignore it and supply your own media files.

## Usage

```bash
$: pnpm install

$: npm run serve
```
